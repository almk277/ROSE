ROSE stands for Real Object Slim Environment.
This is virtual machine similar to JVM.

Key properties are:
	* support for object-oriented programming;
	* short addresses;
	* modularity and late binding;
	* static code verification;
	* garbage collector;
	* written in ANSI C;
	* but optionally can use additional libraries.

It is planned as a whole platform:
	* VM itself (in development);
	* assembler (done);
	* high-level language compiler (planned);
	* hardware-level kernel, which turns ROSE into OS
	  (under consideration).
